## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Test Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Create new Railway project** for testing
2. **Connect to new GitHub repository**
3. **Upload these files** to the repository
4. **Set environment variables** (see below)
5. **Deploy and test** all features
6. **Once confirmed working** → deploy to production

### Option 2: Direct Production Deployment
1. **Backup your current system** (create Railway project fork)
2. **Replace backend files** with these unified files
3. **Set environment variables** (see below)
4. **Deploy to Railway**

### Required Environment Variables
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID=price_xxx_for_19_plan
STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_xxx_for_99_plan  
STRIPE_EXPERT_PRICE_ID=price_xxx_for_499_plan
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx_for_webhooks
```

### File Structure
```

```

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Railway Deployment
1. **Upload files** to your GitHub repository
2. **Rename** `main_unified.py` to `main.py`
3. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard
4. **Deploy** and check health endpoint: `/health`

### 2. Frontend Integration
1. **Add** `frontend_integration.js` to your HTML file
2. **Revolutionary buttons** will appear automatically
3. **Existing functionality** remains unchanged
4. **New modes** available via buttons

### 3. Stripe Configuration
1. **Create price objects** in Stripe dashboard:
   - Basic Plan: $19/month recurring
   - Professional Plan: $99/month recurring  
   - Expert Plan: $499/month recurring
2. **Copy price IDs** to environment variables
3. **Set up webhook** endpoint: `/api/payments/webhook`

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Endpoints
- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **20 Agents**: `GET /api/agents/all`
- **Expert Panel**: `POST /api/revolutionary-relay/start-expert-panel`
- **Conference Chain**: `POST /api/revolutionary-relay/start-conference-chain`
- **Human Simulator**: `POST /api/human-simulator/start-session`
- **Payment Plans**: `GET /api/payments/plans`

### Test Revolutionary Features
1. **Expert Panel Mode**:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/api/revolutionary-relay/start-expert-panel', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
     body: JSON.stringify({prompt: 'Analyze the future of AI'})
   })
   ```

2. **Conference Chain Mode**:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/api/revolutionary-relay/start-conference-chain', {
     method: 'POST', 
     headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
     body: JSON.stringify({prompt: 'Solve climate change', max_agents: 20})
   })
   ```

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Endpoints (Still Work)
- `/api/chat` → Redirects to unified agents system
